Equality: Ensure text, icons, spacing, and visual weight are distributed evenly so no element feels more dominant than others unless intended by hierarchy.

Balance: Use clear alignment (center, left, or grid-based) to create visual stability. Avoid clutter, uneven spacing, or misalignment that breaks harmony.

Consistency: Apply a uniform style for typography, colors, padding, margins, and component shapes. Reuse patterns (buttons, cards, headers, inputs) instead of redesigning variations.

Compact Mobile Design: Always make the design compact in Mobile view and extend responsively for Desktop view.
